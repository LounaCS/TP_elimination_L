*TP NGS 2021: genome elimination in Mesorhabditis belari.*

Samples were obtained from Mesorhabditis belari embryos at different stades: *1,2,4,8 cells, then 5h and 7h after the 8 cells stade)* in duplicate.
The raw data are FastQ files of the 12 sampling sequencing.
We conduct here quality analysis, data cleaning and mapping of the reads on the reference genome.
